\chapter{Feynman Rules and Diagrams}
Here we introduce the methods for evaluating path integrals due to Feynman. We will be working in a scalar $\phi^3$ theory for instructive purposes, all more complicated theories differ only superficially from the procedure prescribed here. First, we draw Feynman diagrams to correspond to certain terms in a perturbation expansion of the path integral, which look like particles interacting via exchanging other particles. Then, we describe how such diagrams can be converted into numbers.
